# Do-Try-Catch

Very simple example for do-try-catch (Swift 4.1)

 Theory:
 
 * Do-try-catch is used to handle errors for functions which "throws" errors
 * Do-try-catch syntax was added to make eroor handling clearer and safer
 * Error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions in your program. Swift provides first-class support for throwing, catching, propagating, and manipulating recoverable errors at runtime.
